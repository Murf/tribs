h1. Introduction

This plug-in is designed to build expose a contribution report, displaying the effort, typically in work logged, contributed by each user.

h1. API

As the objective of this plug-in is to expose some information to other systems a detailed description of the interface is required.

As this is hosted in JIRA some basic rules apply, firstly a segment of the URI is controlled by this application which we will call the "base" URI.

/jira/trib-rest/1.0/

Beyond the end of this URI is under the control of our plug-in, through the use of JSR311 tags. 

The first URI retrieves a list of user contributions with a sum of hours contributed to each project. This can also takes two parameters, start date and end date to supply the same report constrained by a given period.

No params is all contributions ever.

/jira/trib-rest/1.0/contributions/all

With parameters, note the start date is inclusive and end date is exclusive.

/jira/trib-rest/1.0/contributions/period?startDate=2010-06-01&endDate=2010-07-01
