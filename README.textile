h2. Examples

As this is really just a couple of REST based resource interfaces at the moment it is easiest to illustrate it's function through some examples.

This sample has two projects in JIRA and two users, each user has logged work to both projects.

The URL to retrieve a summary of contributions is as follows:

* This URL will retrieve all contributions to projects by all users.
<pre>
http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/tribs-rest/1.0/contributions/all.xml?os_username=admin&os_password=admin
</pre>
* This will do the same for a given period.
<pre>
http://localhost:2990/jira/rest/tribs-rest/1.0/contributions/period.xml?os_username=admin&os_password=admin&startDate=2010-01-01&endDate=2010-02-01
</pre>
 
A sample of the output is as follows.
<pre>
{
   "code":200,
   "message":"Success",
   "userContributions":[
      {
         "userid":"admin",
         "fullName":"admin",
         "projectTimeSpentList":[
            {
               "projectName":"STAR4 Application",
               "projectKey":"STAR",
               "timespent":7200
            },
            {
               "projectName":"fxassetman",
               "projectKey":"FXA",
               "timespent":7200
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}
</pre>
